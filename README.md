This repository contains my code and projects from the FruitPunch AI in Practice BootCamp (Online), which I started in March 2023 and am currently enrolled in. In this bootcamp, I have gained practical experience in several machine learning techniques using various datasets. Below is a brief summary of my experience so far:

Machine Learning Techniques
Trained models from the scikit-learn library with various datasets and evaluated the models' accuracy and R squared score.
Used Keras API from the TensorFlow library to build neural networks and optimize their mean squared error value for predicting Boston housing prices.
Developed a convolutional neural network from scratch using Keras packages from the TensorFlow library.
Optimized a convolutional neural network using dropout and batch normalization to achieve 98% accuracy for the model.
Projects
Throughout this bootcamp, I have worked on several projects applying the techniques learned in class. These projects have included:

Predicting Boston housing prices using a neural network.
Classifying images of clothing items using a convolutional neural network.
Identifying different types of flowers using a convolutional neural network.
Conclusion
Overall, the FruitPunch AI in Practice BootCamp (Online) has provided me with valuable hands-on experience in machine learning techniques, which I look forward to applying to future projects. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about my experience, please feel free to reach out.
